[] increase timer rate (period = 20us)
[] add a second MQTT option to allow for specific IP addr as well as hostname - then try them alternately (if both specified) until connected
[] MQTT seems to be hanging in some circumstances
[] MQTT rate throttling or reduce change detect sensitivity maybe - too many messages in ScaderOpener?

Build System:
[] changes to UI don't trigger rebuild with idf.py build
